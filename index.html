<h3>To the National Political Committee of DSA:</h3>
<p>I am calling on you to consider Resolution 11 - DSA Law Enforcement Exclusion, which was unable to reach the floor during the 2019 DSA National Convention.</p>
<p>As current and historical events have shown, police are fundamentally incompatible with the goals of a socialist organization such as DSA. Our goal, as socialists, is to abolish private property and seize the means of production, while the primary function of the police is to control society - specifically the working class and people of color, and the protection of private property. Collaboration with police or their supporters is antithetical to everything DSA stands for and does not represent the interests of the working class as a whole.</p>
<p>As socialists, we are fighting for a more just world. Part of achieving that goal is stating clearly that the police, prisons, prosecution, and all aspects of the carceral state as they exist today cannot be reformed and must be abolished. These systems rely on, reinforce, and perpetuate the structures of white supremacy, patriarchy, xenophobia, ableism in order to enable capitalism. I call on you to use your power to enact Resolution 11 and forbid police, police organizers, and any member who seeks to uphold the oppressive capitalist police state.</p>
<blockquote>Resolution 11 states:
Therefore be it resolved, employment as a Law Enforcement Officer is in opposition to the principles of the organization as outlined in the DSA Constitution Article II. Persons employed as Law Enforcement Officers are therefore excluded from membership in DSA.</blockquote>
